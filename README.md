# Macro-Parser

Have you ever faced the situation in which you have to know the value of a specific macro in C/C++ inside of a project.\
But this macro is defined by so much many other macros and hexadecimal values are used.\
Calculating it manually would take too much time and energy, and you wouldn't be sure of the result.\
I have the solution for you: Macro Parser.\
Using a few command line you can calculate the value of almost any macro.\
This tool is only working on Windows for now, but ports can be easily created.
